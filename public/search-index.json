[{"content":"<p><em>‘One can make a map without shades and colors, but not without lines’</em><br>\n<em>-Erwin Raisz</em>, Principles of Cartography</p>\n<p>Lines are foundational to how maps communicate. Take, for instance, the map on your smart phone. They guide you home from a new restuarant, tell you how tall a mountain is, and warn you not to stray too far in the wrong direction. They comestimes even tell you about the life a map has lived. Over centuries, mapmakers have devloped (and abandoned) an amazing variety of ways to use lines to bring our world to life. This exhibition follows lines on maps to their extremes in examples from mundane textbooks to avant-garde art. Through these lines, maps rationalize their world view, even as they reveal perspectives that are neither universal nor neutral.</p>\n<p>The exhibition’s sections each delve into a fundamental kind of line on maps as they developed in Europe and the Americas. Chart your own path through the following pages to explore how lines define—and simultaneously subvert—the rules that make maps legible.</p>\n<figure id=\"wynne\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#wynne\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https:/dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/_assets/images/wynne.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Page from Michael Wynne’s <em>England</em></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"https:/dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/_assets/images/wynne.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Page from Michael Wynne’s <em>England</em></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Throughout this exhibition, you will encounter artists who manipulate, deform, and even destroy maps. For the artist Michael Wynne, the lines on maps offer an expansive tool to bring together typical map elements, like borders and coasts, alongside unexpected insertions, like bodies and blood. By drawing and painting over pages of a national atlas, Wynne connects different kinds of lines—from a line-drawing of a body, to blood lines, to lines of text, to train lines—to meditate on identity, nationalism, and sexuality. Like many artists in this exhibition, Wynne alters and replaces parts of the map to critique it on its own terms.</p>\n","length":314,"title":"Introduction","type":"cover","url":"https://dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Contents","type":"table-of-contents","url":"https://dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/contents/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Catalogue","type":"table-of-contents","url":"https://dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/catalogue/"},{"content":"<p>Numerous small and large variations in lines allow mapmakers to communicate all sorts of facts, stories, and concepts.

By standardizing these symbols, texts that direct mapmakers how to use lines spread a European tradition of mapping throughout the world.

These techniques, most notably hachure lines and contour lines, met the dual demands that a map be both scientific and visually engaging.</p>\n<p>Hachure lines run parallel to the slope. Short, thick strokes show a steep pitch and long, thin strokes show a gradual incline. Mapmakers often combine hachure lines with crosshatching—the network of intersecting lines artists use in printmaking to create shading—to enhance the illusion of depth. Contour lines, in contrast, run perpendicular to the slope. Each contour indicates a consistent change in altitude and is often paired with a numerical key for mathematical precision.</p>\n","length":136,"title":"Altitude","type":"table-of-contents","url":"https://dewmaps.github.io/Mapping-Outside-the-Lines/catalogue/altitude/"},{"content":"<p>As geographer to the French king, Philippe Buache experimented with techniques for communicating scientific discoveries about the world.

Journey lines became especially prolific on maps illustrating travel literature as that genre grew in popularity in the late nineteenth century.

Cage’s score consists of 128 sets of addresses (or 430 addresses)—labeled quicksteps, waltzes, and marches for the number of beats in a measure—in the larger Chicago area. The score provides no specific instructions on what to do with these addresses. Cage also produced a map with the score where each line connects these randomly generated addresses.
