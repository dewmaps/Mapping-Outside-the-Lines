At the end of World War I, some politicians like Lithuanian Jouzas Gabrys used ethnographic maps to argue that Europe had natural, ethnic borders that should dictate its new political borders to secure international peace. But, in this map, Gabrysâ€™s argument about ethnic nation-states still relied on the binary logic of boundaries to redraw nations. His dependence on boundary lines inscribed majority rule over areas with ethnic diversity and historical complexity, foreshadowing future conflicts.

 For an example of the binary logic of borders, look at the border of Slovakia and Hungary, where alternating lines of green and yellow show an area split between two ethnicities, preventing representation of other ethnic groups in the area.
